# How to add a new skill (for AI agents)

A contributor asked you to add a new skill to this repo. Follow these steps.

## Files to create

1. **`skills/apify-<name>/SKILL.md`** — copy from `skills/_template/SKILL.md` and replace every `REPLACE` placeholder. Required frontmatter:
   - `name: apify-<name>` (must match the folder name; kebab-case)
   - `description: ...` (≤ 1024 characters; include trigger phrases the user would say)
   - `author: ...` (optional)
   - `author_url: https://...` (optional)
2. **`skills/apify-<name>/references/actor-index.md`** and **`references/gotchas.md`** — copy the templates from `skills/_template/references/` and fill them in. Optional but recommended.

## Marketplace entry

Add one entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in the `plugins` array:

```json
{
  "name": "apify-<name>",
  "source": "./skills/apify-<name>",
  "skills": "./",
  "description": "Brief description",
  "keywords": ["apify", "..."],
  "category": "data-extraction",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Rules

- **One skill per PR.** CI rejects PRs that touch multiple skills (unless a maintainer adds the `maintainer` label).
- **No unnecessary changes.** Edit only files inside `skills/apify-<name>/` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
- **Do not edit** `agents/AGENTS.md` or the skills table in `README.md` — both are regenerated from frontmatter after merge.
- **Use Apify Actors only** — they must be publicly available on the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store).

## Calling Actors — your choice

This repo does not mandate any specific interface. Pick one of:

- **Apify CLI** (`apify actors call ...`) — recommended for portability; see [`skills/_template/SKILL.md`](../skills/_template/SKILL.md) for the three flags to include on every call.
- **Apify MCP connector** at <https://mcp.apify.com>.
- **MCP client** of your choice (e.g. [mcpc](https://github.com/apify/mcpc)).

Whichever you pick, cross-tool compatibility is your responsibility.

## Validation

Run locally before opening the PR:

```bash
uv run scripts/generate_agents.py
```

This checks marketplace ↔ SKILL.md sync, validates `name`/`description`/`author_url` formats, and regenerates `agents/AGENTS.md` + the README skills table. CI runs the same script on the PR.
