# Awesome Apify Skills

[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/apify/awesome-skills)](https://skills.sh/apify/awesome-skills)

Community collection of [Apify](https://apify.com) agent skills for web scraping, data extraction, and automation.

> Companion to [apify/agent-skills](https://github.com/apify/agent-skills), the home of official Apify-maintained skills. This repo collects community contributions that follow the same [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) open standard.

## What's a skill?

A skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter that teaches an AI agent how to do a specific task with [Apify Actors](https://apify.com/store) — which Actors to use, how to build inputs, how to handle errors.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add apify/awesome-skills
```

Works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, OpenCode, and [50+ other agents](https://skills.sh). Pass `--list` to preview, `-s <name>` to install one specific skill.
